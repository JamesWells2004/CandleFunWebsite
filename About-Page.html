      <h2 class="h2-1 aboutsizestyle aH2">About Me</h2>
      <p class="pfontstuff">When this was made I was taking a class in school called Web Design.<br>
        In web design we were taught how to create a website and everyone in the class<br>
        created their own website and I decided to make a website on a hobby that I wanted to get into.</p><br>
      <h2 class="h2-1 aboutsizestyle aH2">Hobbies</h2>
      <p class="pfontstuff">I have many hobbies and one of those is marching band. Marching band is something that got me to do candles because of<br>
        how my room always smells no matter hwat and I just want it to smell nice. When I started creating candles I would<br>
        start out on cheap things like plastice cases or even cardboard just to get to know how to do it.<br>
        by doing candles it also calms me down after a long day of marching band and all that walking when I just want to relax.</p><br>
      <h2 class="h2-1 aboutsizestyle aH2">My Life</h2>
      <p class="pfontstuff">My life is the smae almose every day. I go to school and then I do my day then I go to marching band when<br>
        that happens or to my bus to go home when there is no marching band. When I get home I will nromally start<br>
        on my homework so taht I can have a free afternoon. Somedays I have to do other things like mowing the lawn<br>
        and other things like that. But otherwise all the days of my highschool career have been the same so far.<br>
        On some weekends I will work but others I may have a band competiton or I may just not want to do anything.</p><br>
