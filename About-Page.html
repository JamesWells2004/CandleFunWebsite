    <h2>About Me</h2><br>
    <p>When this was made I was taking a class in school called Web Design.<br>
      In web design we were taught how to create a website and everyone in the class<br>
      created their own website and I decided to make a website on a hobby that I wanted to getr into.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2><br>
    <p>I have many hobbies and one of those is marching band. Marching band is something that got me to do candles because of<br>
      how my room always smells no matter hwat and I just want it to smell nice. When I started creating candles I would<br>
      start out on cheap things like plastice cases or even cardboard just to get to know how to do it.<br>
      by doing candles it also calms me down after a long day of marching band and all that walking when i just want to relax.</p>
